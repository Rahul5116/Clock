# Digital Clock Project

Welcome to my Digital Clock project! This is a simple Java Swing application that displays the current date and time using a digital clock. It was created as part of my learning journey in Java.

## Features

- **JFrame**: Utilized to create the main window of the application.
- **GridLayout**: Used to arrange components in a 2x1 grid layout.
- **Timer**: Updates the clock every second to show the current date and time.
